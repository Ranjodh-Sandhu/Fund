						<h3>Smart Screening Credit Score</h3>
						<p>We understand that life happens. At fundd, we believe that people should not be defined by one number, their credit score. To address this, we have developed a Smart Screening Technology that allows borrowers to give more information about themselves. Using this information and our special algorithm, fundd analyzes the risk of lending based off of many different factors such as loan type, education, background, etc. This way, people who may have had one bad experience that has ruined their credit scores still have an opportunity to receive funding from others. </p>

								<h3>Lower Interest Rates</h3>
								<p>Because banks are not a part of the equation, investors can receive a much larger share of their returns. This means that lower interest rates (compared to banks and other financial institutions) can be used. This way, both the lenders and the borrowers are benefitting.</p>

							<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
								<h3>Convenient</h3>
								<p>Technology has made it easier than ever to get the funds to a borrower as quickly as possible. There is no need to meet in person to sign contracts as it can all be done online. Once individually onboarded and fully processed, we take advantage of top of the line payment processing to put capital in your hands immediately without you ever having to take a trip to a brick and mortar bank.</p>
